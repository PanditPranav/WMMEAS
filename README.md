## Abstract  
The ability to rapidly detect and respond to wildlife morbidity and mortality events is critical for reducing threats for wildlife populations. Surveillance systems that utilize pre-diagnostic data can contribute to early detection of wildlife morbidities caused by disease and anthropogenic and ecologic disturbances, including environmental pollution and climate change. Here we demonstrate proof of concept for a wildlife disease surveillance tool, the “Wildlife Morbidity and Mortality Event Alert System” (WMME Alert System), that integrates pre-diagnostic data in near real-time from a network of wildlife rehabilitation organizations to detect and alert to unusual wildlife health events. The system classifies pre-diagnostic data into relevant clinical classifications based on a natural language processing algorithm, generating alerts when more than the expected number of cases are recorded across the wildlife rehabilitation network. We demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in alerting to cases associated with both common diseases as well as emerging threats. Tapping into this readily available unconventional surveillance data stream offers efficiency and added value to existing active wildlife disease surveillance systems.
